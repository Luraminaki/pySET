      <h2>HISTORY</h2>
      <ul>
        <p><b>SET!</b> is a real-time card game designed by <b>Marsha Falco</b> in 1974.</p>
        <p>The game evolved out of a coding system that the designer used in her job as a geneticist. The shapes are based on those in ISO 5807.</p>
        <p><b>SET!</b> won American Mensa's Mensa Select award in 1991 and placed 9th in the 1995 Deutscher Spiele Preis.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>PREPARATIONS</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>The game can be played alone or in group.</p>
        <p>The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features across three possibilities for each kind of feature: number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple).</p>
        <p>Each possible combination of features (e.g. a card with three striped green diamonds) appears as a card precisely once in the deck.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>RULES</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>A set consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions:</p>
        <li><p>They all have the same number or have three different numbers.</p></li>
        <li><p>They all have the same shape or have three different shapes.</p></li>
        <li><p>They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.</p></li>
        <li><p>They all have the same color or have three different colors.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>The rules of <b>SET!</b> are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into "two of ____ and one of ____", then it is <b>not</b> a set.</p>
      </ul>
